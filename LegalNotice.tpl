I. Beta Test
</h2>

 
<p>
Section 851 of Public Law 112-239 requires the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) to establish and maintain a database of pricing information for items and services for use by Federal acquisition officials.  Developing a prices paid database is critical to ensuring that contracting officers and program managers have the information needed to negotiate contracts in the best interest of the taxpayer, and it is a top priority for OFPP.  The portal has been developed through the Office of Science and Technology Policy’s Presidential Innovative Fellows, with infrastructure support from the General Services Administration, and funding from the Chief Acquisition Officers Council.

<p>
At this time, we are beta testing the portal for a limited number of commodities, such as certain information technology (IT) products.   The purpose of this beta test is to obtain feedback on the portal’s usability, including challenges encountered, in order to improve the quality of the product; measure and improve performance in real-world environments; identify requirements for potential future revisions; and build awareness of the portal for an upcoming launch.  For these reasons, on the left side of the portal screen you will see the word "Feedback".  Clicking on this word will open a Feedback form that allows you to enter comments, which we will later read.  Please assist us any giving feedback on what you like or don't like about the site, including what features may be missing that would make it truly useful to you. Disclosure (or providing) of information requested in forms contained within this system or provided via email contact is "voluntary."
