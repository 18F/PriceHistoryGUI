Welcome an instance of Prices Paid
</h1>

<p>
Prices Paid is free and open-source software originially developed by the US Government to save the taxpayer money by arming 
procurement officers with information about the actual, real prices paid for goods and services.
</p>

<p>
Although developed by the Federal Government, the code is in the public domain and may be used by any State, Municipality, or large organization that wants an google-like search of pricing information.
</p>

<p>
This software has no warranty, and is a work in progress.  You can actively participate in its development, either by identifying bugs, features that would make it more valuable, or contributing data or code.  For more information, please see the github repository by searching github for 18F/PricesPaidGUI.
