* Need to fix bug which is keeping detail area from working.
Basically now need to focus efforts on making detail area useful.

Priorities:

* Fix fact that detials don't work
* Add custom fields into detail (retrieved by Ajax query)
*) Load up more custom fields
*) Allow template scrolling
*) Improve login
*) Publish for upcoming demos

... then I can go ont to the big bits of work, which are creating 
a persistent store and using full-text indexing.
